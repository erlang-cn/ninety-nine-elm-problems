# Problem 49
The [Gray Code](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GrayCode.html) is a binary numbering system used in error correction system. It can be generated for different bit sizes using a *reflecting* pattern. To generate a two-bit code, take the single bit Gray code 0, 1. Write it forwards, then backwards: 0, 1, 1, 0. Prepend 0s to the first half and 1s to the second half: 00, 01, 11, 10. To generate a 3-bit code, write 00, 01, 11, 10, 10, 11, 01, 00 to obtain: 000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100.
## Example
```elm
grayCode 3 == [[0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,1], [0,1,0], [1,1,0], [1,1,1], [1,0,1], [1,0,0]]
```
## Unit Test
```elm
import Html
import List


-- generate an array of integers encoded with Gray's binary code
grayCodes : Int -> List (List Int)
grayCodes numBits =
    let
        n =
            max 0 numBits
    in
        case n of
            0 ->
                []

            1 ->
                [ [ 0 ], [ 1 ] ]

            _ ->
                let
                    n =
                        abs numBits

                    xs =
                        grayCodes (n - 1)
                in
                    (List.map ((::) 0) xs) ++ (List.map ((::) 1) (List.reverse xs))


main =
    Html.text
        (if (test) then
            "Your implementation passed all tests."
         else
            "Your implementation failed at least one test."
        )

        , grayCodes 4 == [ [ 0, 0, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 0, 1 ], [ 0, 0, 1, 1 ], [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 1, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 0, 1, 0, 1 ], [ 0, 1, 0, 0 ], [ 1, 1, 0, 0 ], [ 1, 1, 0, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, 0 ], [ 1, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 1, 0, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 0, 0, 1 ], [ 1, 0, 0, 0 ] ]
        , testGray 4 (grayCodes 4)
        , testGray 5 (grayCodes 5)
        , testGray 8 (grayCodes 8)
        , testGray 13 (grayCodes 13)
        ]


getDeltas : List (List Int) -> List Int

    case xs of
        [] ->
            [ 0 ]

        [ g1, g2 ] ->
            [ abs ((List.sum g1) - (List.sum g2)) ]

        g1 :: g2 :: gs ->
            abs ((List.sum g1) - (List.sum g2)) :: getDeltas (g2 :: gs)



-- In the Gray bit code the sum of the bits of two neighboring numbers
-- is always 1


testGray : Int -> List (List Int) -> Bool
testGray bits xs =
    let
        highest =
            Maybe.withDefault [ -5 ] <|
                List.head <|
                    List.reverse xs

        one =
            Maybe.withDefault [ -5 ] <|
                List.head <|
                    Maybe.withDefault [ [ -5 ] ] <|
                        List.tail xs

        zero =
            Maybe.withDefault [ -5 ] <|
                List.head xs

        deltas =
            getDeltas xs
    in
        List.all ((==) True)
            [ List.sum highest == 1
            , List.sum one == 1
            , List.length xs == 2 ^ bits
            , List.sum zero == 0
            ]
            && List.all ((==) 1) deltas

```
## Hints
1. Use the reflecting nature of the Gray code to recursively solve for the answer.
