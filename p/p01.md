# Problem 1

Write a function ```last``` that returns the last element of a list. An empty list doesn't have a last element, therefore ```last``` must return a Maybe. 

## Example
Cut and paste the following code into the online compiler [http://elm-lang.org/try](http://elm-lang.org/try). Insert your implementation of ```last``` and test.

```elm
import Html exposing (text)
import Maybe


last : List a -> Maybe a
last xs = 
  -- your implementation goes here
  Nothing


main =
    case last [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] of
        Just a ->
            text (toString a)

        Nothing ->
            text "No element found"
 ```

Result:

```
4
```

## Unit Test 
Let's create a more complete test, checking ```last``` against an empty list and lists of different types. We will use ```assertEqual``` which takes a tuple, where the first element will hold a test condition and the second holds the expected result. This will allow us to test multiple conditions concisely.

Cut and paste the following code into the online compiler [http://elm-lang.org/try](http://elm-lang.org/try). Insert your implementation of ```last``` and test.

```elm
import Html
import List
import Maybe


last : List a -> Maybe a
last xs =
    -- your implementation goes here
    Nothing


main : Html.Html a
main =
    Html.text
        <| case test of
            0 ->
                "Your implementation passed all tests."

            1 ->
                "Your implementation failed one test."

            x ->
                "Your implementation failed " ++ (toString x) ++ " tests."


test : Int
test =
    List.length
        <| List.filter ((==) False)
            [ last (1..4) == Just 4
            , last [ 1 ] == Just 1
            , last [] == Nothing
            , last [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ] == Just 'c'
            ]
            
            
(..) : Int -> Int -> List Int
(..) start end =
    List.range start end
```

## Hints
Here are 2 hints to solve the problem:
1. Use recursion.
2. How can you leverage a List's ```head``` function to solve this problem?
