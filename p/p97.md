# Problem 97

In a sudoku puzzle, every spot in the puzzle belongs to a row and a column, as well as to one single 3x3 square. At the beginning, some of the spots already carry a number between 1 and 9. The challenge is to fill the missing spots with digits in such a way that every number between 1 and 9 appears exactly once in each row, in each column, and in each square.
