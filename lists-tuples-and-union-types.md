# Lists and Tuples

## What's a Tuple
A Tuple is a fixed length collection of elements. Unlike Lists, a tuple can mix types. The type of the tuple depends on the types of its elements. Thus a

`(Int, String) `

is a different type from a

`(String, Int)`

is different from a

`(Int, String, String, String)`
