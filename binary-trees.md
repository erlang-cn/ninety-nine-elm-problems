### Traverse a Tree
Solving these three tree traversal problems will make it easier to solve the rest of the tree challenges

* [Problem 68a](p/p68a.md) - Extract a list of nodes of a tree in pre-order. 
* [Problem 68b](p/p68b.md) - Extract a list of nodes of a tree in in-order. 
* [Problem 68c](p/p68c.md) - Generate a tree from a pre-order list of nodes.
