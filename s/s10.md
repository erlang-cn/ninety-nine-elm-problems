# Problem 10 Solution

### Solution 1
1. Use ```List.map``` to convert from ```List (Int, a)``` to ```List (Int, Maybe a)```. 
2. Use ```removeNothings``` to convert to ```List (Int, a)```. 


```elm
import List exposing (map, length, head)
runLengths : List (List a) -> List ( Int, a )
runLengths xss =
    map (\xs -> ( length xs, head xs )) xss |> removeNothings


removeNothings : List ( Int, Maybe a ) -> List ( Int, a )
removeNothings xs =
    case xs of
        [] ->
            []

        ( len, Nothing ) :: rest ->
            removeNothings rest

        ( len, Just y ) :: rest ->
            ( len, y ) :: removeNothings rest
```
