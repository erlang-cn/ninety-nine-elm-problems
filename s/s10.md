# Problem 10 Solution

### Solution 1

```elm
runLengths : List (List a) -> List ( Int, a )
runLengths xss =
  case xss of
    [] ->
      []
    ys :: yys ->
      case ys of
        [] ->
          runLengths yys
        z :: zs ->
          ( List.length ys, z ) :: runLengths yys
```



### Solution 2

1. Use `List.map` to convert from `List (Int, a)` to `List (Int, Maybe a)`. 
2. Use `removeNothings` to convert to `List (Int, a)`. 

```elm
runLengths : List (List a) -> List ( Int, a )
runLengths xss =
    map (\xs -> ( length xs, head xs )) xss |> removeNothings


removeNothings : List ( Int, Maybe a ) -> List ( Int, a )
removeNothings xs =
    case xs of
        [] ->
            []

        ( len, Nothing ) :: rest ->
            removeNothings rest

        ( len, Just y ) :: rest ->
            ( len, y ) :: removeNothings rest
```
