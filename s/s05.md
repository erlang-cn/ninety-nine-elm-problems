# Problem 5 Solutions


## Solution 1 - fold

```
myReverse : List a -> List a
myReverse xs =
    List.foldl (::) [] xs
```

## Solution 2 - recursion
```elm
myReverse : List a -> List a
myReverse list =
    case list of 
        [] ->
            []
            
        x :: xs ->
            (myReverse xs) ++ [x]
```
