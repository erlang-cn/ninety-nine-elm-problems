### Solution 1
List.concatMap makes this easy. 

```elm
rleDecode : List (RleCode a) -> List a
rleDecode list =
    List.concatMap f list
    

f : RleCode a -> List a
f code = 
    case code of 
        Single x ->
            [ x ]
            
        Run n x -> 
            List.repeat n x 
```
