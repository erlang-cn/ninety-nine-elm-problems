# Problem 4 Solutions

### Solution #1:
Recursive solution

```elm
countElements : List a -> Int
countElements list =
    case list of
        [ ] -> 0
        _ :: ys -> 1 + countElements ys
```

### Solution #2:

Recursive solution with accumulator

```elm
countElements : List a -> Int
countElements list =
    let
        countElements_acc list_ acc =
            case list_ of
                [ ] -> acc
                (_::xs) -> countElements_acc xs (acc + 1)
    in
        countElements_acc list 0
```

### Solution #3:

Use foldl. This is how Elm core defines ```List.length```.

```elm
countElements : List a -> Int
countElements list = List.foldl (\_ n -> n + 1) 0 list

```

### Solution #4:

Convert elements to 1 using ```List.map``` and ```List.sum```.

```elm
countElements : List a -> Int
countElements list = List.sum <| List.map (\n -> 1) list
```
