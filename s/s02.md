# Problem 2 Solutions

### Solution 1:
Recursive search for the last element

```
penultimate : List a -> Maybe a
penultimate list = 
  case list of
    [ ] -> Nothing
    [y] -> Nothing
    [y, z] -> Just y
    y::ys -> penultimate ys

```
### Solution 2: 
Reverse the list and take the head of the tail.
```
penultimate : List a -> Maybe a
penultimate list = 
  case List.reverse list of
    [ ] -> Nothing
    y::ys -> List.head ys

```
### Solution 3: 
Reverse the list, drop one and take the head. 
```
penultimate : List a -> Maybe a
penultimate list = 
  case drop 1 (List.reverse list) of
    [ ] -> Nothing
    y::ys -> Just y


```
