# Problem 35 - Prime factors
## Solution 1
Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find primes, then test each prime from lowest to highest. 

```elm
import Html
import List
import Maybe


primeFactors : Int -> List Int
primeFactors n =
    List.reverse <| factors n (primes n) []


factors : Int -> List Int -> List Int -> List Int
factors n ps acc =
    case ps of
        [] ->
            acc

        x :: xs ->
            if n == x then
                x :: acc
            else if n % x == 0 then
                factors (n // x) ps (x :: acc)
            else
                factors n xs acc



-- find all primes up to n


primes : Int -> List Int
primes n =
    if n < 2 then
        []
    else
        eratos (List.range 2 n) []



-- sieve of Eratosthenes
-- remove all the the non-primes from a list


eratos : List Int -> List Int -> List Int
eratos candidates primes =
    case candidates of
        [] ->
            List.reverse primes

        x :: xs ->
            let
                cs =
                    List.filter (\y -> (y % x) /= 0) xs
            in
                eratos cs (x :: primes)

 ```          
## Solution 2

We can optimize the first solution by eliminating primes between n/2 and n. 
```elm
primeFactors : Int -> List Int
primeFactors n =
    if n < 2 then
        []
    else
        List.reverse <| factors n ((primes (n // 2)) ++ [ n ]) []
```

## Solution 3
Faster still, use ```dropWhile``` to sieve the prime numbers for you  
```elm
primeFactors : Int -> List Int
primeFactors n =
    if n < 2 then
        []
    else
        let
            prime =
                Maybe.withDefault 0
                    <| List.head
                    <| dropWhile (\x -> n % x /= 0) [2..n]
        in
            prime :: (primeFactors <| n // prime)


dropWhile : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> List a
dropWhile predicate list =
    case list of
        [] ->
            []

        x :: xs ->
            if (predicate x) then
                dropWhile predicate xs
            else
                list

```
